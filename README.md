# Introduction to Robotics (2023 - 2024)

Dear reader,

Hello there, this will be the repo where I will upload all the homework in the discipline *Introduction to Robotics*, a dear subject to me that I attended in my 3rd year at *the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest*. For each homework, I will provide a well-explained code, alongside the task requirements, and the result presented in image files and a video.

Thank you very much for reading this,
 
 GeorgeðŸŽ¯

P.S.
