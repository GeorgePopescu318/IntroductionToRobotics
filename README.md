Dear reader,

Hello there, this will be the repo where I will upload all the homework in the discipline *Introduction to Robotics*, a dear subject to me that I attended in my 3rd year at *the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest*. For each homework, I will provide a well-explained code, alongside the task requirements, and the result presented in image files and a video.

Thank you very much for reading this,
 
 GeorgeðŸŽ¯

P.S.

## [Homework 2](https://github.com/GeorgePopescu318/IntroductionToRobotics/tree/main/Homework2)

Task:

Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  This control must leveragedigital electronics.  Specifically,you  need  to  read  the  potentiometer`s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins.

## [Homework 3](https://github.com/GeorgePopescu318/IntroductionToRobotics/tree/main/Homework3)

Task:

This  assignment  involves  simulating  a  3-floor  elevator  control  system  usingLEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with Arduino. By the end of this task, you will gainexperience in using button state change, implementing debouncing techniques,and coordinating multiple components to represent real-world scenarios.

## [Homework 4](https://github.com/GeorgePopescu318/IntroductionToRobotics/tree/main/Homework4)

Description:

The following code allows you to move through a 7-segment Display using a joystick, the current LED segment will blink so you know where you are,
  additionally by short pressing the joystick/an external button the current segment will turn HIGH after you move your current segment from it, and you can turn them LOW if you
  short press again. By long pressing the joystick/button all the HIGH segments will turn LOW and the current segment will return to dp (decimal point).
