# Introduction to Robotics (2023 - 2024)

Dear reader,

Hello there, this will be the repo where I will upload all the homework in the discipline *Introduction to Robotics*, a dear subject to me that I attended in my 3rd year at *the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest*. For each homework, I will provide a well-explained code, alongside the task requirements, and the result presented in image files and a video.

Thank you very much for reading this,
 
 GeorgeðŸŽ¯

P.S.

## [Homework 2](https://github.com/GeorgePopescu318/IntroductionToRobotics/tree/main/Homework2)

Task:

Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  This control must leveragedigital electronics.  Specifically,you  need  to  read  the  potentiometer`s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins.

## [Homework 2](https://github.com/GeorgePopescu318/IntroductionToRobotics/tree/main/Homework2)

Task:

This  assignment  involves  simulating  a  3-floor  elevator  control  system  usingLEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with Arduino. By the end of this task, you will gainexperience in using button state change, implementing debouncing techniques,and coordinating multiple components to represent real-world scenarios.
